# Quran IndoPak Script

Each json file number corresponds to the sura number.

Fonts for displaying the ayats are in fonts folder.

You can find boxes in json which can be automatically omitted by using [PDMS](https://github.com/pollmix/quran-indopak/tree/master/fonts/pdms) font. Then apply this [css](https://github.com/pollmix/quran-indopak/blob/1ae0f66b39cf61d524668b45340922496cfc3df3/fonts/pdms/style.css#L14) to the arabic text.
